first boot.py and main.py are called: main creates a state_machine robot
state_machine uses sensor_state and states (robot state) with state_functions(state, sensor_state) to run the robot and use callbacks.

state_functions are the robot states defined as in state diagram - moving, toggling, standby, etc.
they depend on sensor_state to read EMGs and switch value (TODO: and encoder), and writes the PWM to motors.

states define what states are in general, creates the actual object, while state_functions more define what the states do

motor.py just defines motor pins and what pwm does.

pins.py just define pins.

sensor.py takes the inputs such as Encoder, potmeters and blueswitch.
